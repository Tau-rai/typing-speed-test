# Typing Speed Test App

Welcome to the Typing Speed Test App! This interactive web application is designed to measure your typing speed by challenging you to match a given text as quickly and accurately as possible.

## How It Works

The app presents you with a text file and starts a counter as soon as you begin typing. Your goal is to type out the contents of the text file exactly. The counter stops when you've matched the text, and your typing speed is calculated based on the time taken.

## Features

- **Text Match Challenge**: A text file is loaded into the app for you to replicate.
- **Real-Time Counter**: Measures the time from the moment you start typing until you complete the text.
- **Accuracy Check**: Ensures that the typed text matches the provided text file exactly.
- **Speed Calculation**: Displays your typing speed in words per minute (WPM) after completing the test.

## Built With

- **HTML**: Structures the web application and its content.
- **CSS**: Styles the application to be visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the application's interactivity and logic.
